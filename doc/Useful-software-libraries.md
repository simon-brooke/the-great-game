# Useful software tools and libraries (open source)

## Animation

* [Papagayo](https://www.lostmarble.com/papagayo/) -- lipsync animator, not up to JALI standards, but not nothing! However, not apparently under active development, and in C++.

## Procedural assets

## Textures

* [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/) -- free textures, also HDRI lighting maps and some 3D models, although few look relevant. 

## Others

* [Festival Speech Synthesis](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/download.html) Text to speech library, in C++ but there's a Java transducer.
* [Mary TTS](https://github.com/marytts/marytts) Text to speech library, probably not as good as Festival
