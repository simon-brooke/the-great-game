# My setting for the Great Game

It should be evident that all the key ideas in The Great Game project would be applicable to games set in the historic past of our world, to games set in its present, or to games set in some imagined or forecast future; the ideas are intended to be, and I believe are, largely independent of setting.

Nevertheless I feel the need for a concrete setting to ground the development of ideas. I've chosen deliberately not to place that setting in the real world; although it's broadly based on cultures from the late bronze age/early iron age mediterrainian.
