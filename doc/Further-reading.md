Work by other people which is relevant to what I'm doing, and which I should study.

##Â Modelling the natural environment

### Forests

2. [Modelling Ocean Water](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~jtessen/reports/papers_files/coursenotes2004.pdf)

## Systemic games

1. [This video](https://youtu.be/SnpAAX9CkIc) is thought provoking with excellent examples.

## Procedural animation

1. [This video](https://youtu.be/LNidsMesxSE) builds really impressive character animation on extremely simple foundations. I'm not saying this is easy, but it looks doable.
