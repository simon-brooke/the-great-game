# Things Voice Interaction Enables

## Organic quest routing

In a world in which you can talk to non-player characters, and in which non-player characters know the directions to things which are local to their homes (and some, travellers, will be able to give you routes to things further away), when you need to get to your next waypoint you can just ask for directions. That much is easy.

But something much richer occurred to me.

Suppose you're entering a village, and you meet a random character. That character knows any local quest giver, and what it is that quest giver needs –– and, indeed, they know this whether the quest is scripted or organic.

So the random character could say

> Hello, I'm Tobias, and that my mill over there. Who might you be, stranger?

At which point you can either tell him, or not. Suppose you tell him, he could say

> Oh! I've heard of you. It's said you're very handy with a sword.

And you can reply however you like, acknowledging, or being modest, or perhaps even denying (although from this line of dialogue if you deny he'll think you're being modest, for reasons see later). He can then say, taking our example from the 'abducted child' quest in [the Introduction](intro.html),

> Thing is, old granny Grizzel's granddaughter Esmerelda has been abducted by bandits, and we've done a whip-around for a reward for someone who can rescue the girl.

At which point you may reply that you'll do it, or be non-committal, or say you won't. If you say you will, he can say,

> Well, you should talk to granny Grizzel, she lives in the white house by the crossroads, half a mile that-a-way (pointing).

If you say you won't, he can say,

> It would be a virtuous act, the old lady is fair desperate. If you should change your mind, you should talk to her; she lives in the white house by the crossroads, half a mile that-a-way (pointing).

OK, but what if, in the game world, the player character is not good with a sword? Well, the 'abducted child' quest can be resolved by violence; but it can also be resolved by persuasion, or by sneakiness, or by bribery. So suppose the player isn't (in the game) good with a sword, but is good at negotiation. Then in the initial approach, Tobias could say

> Oh! I've heard of you. It's said you're very handy at persuasion... Thing is, old granny Grizzel's granddaughter Esmerelda has been abducted by bandits, and we've done a whip-around for a ransom, but she's lacking someone who can negotiate for her.

It's the same quest, and, whatever Tobias has said, the player can still use either violence or persuasion or trickery to complete the quest (and gain appropriate reputation thereby), but it's flexible enough to adapt to the player's in-game persona, and it means we can direct the player to quest-givers without having to stick a bloody great icon on the quest giver's head.

So, to repeat for clarity: the idea is, if there is a quest in the vicinity, whether organic or scripted, all the quest giver's neighbours know about it, and will bring it up in conversation, introducing it and directing the player to the quest giver. And I believe that this can be done reasonably naturally.

## Command in Battles

Player characters in role playing games are often narratively great heroic leaders &mdash; see any of the Dragon Age games but particularly Inquisition for examples of this &mdash; but when it comes to a pitched battle all they can do is follow a scripted battle plan and fight individual actions, because in current generation role-playing games there is no effective user interface to allow strategic and tactical control of a battle.

So how would a real-world, before modern communications technology, war leader command a battle? Why, by observing the battle and talking to people, and those are both things that in our game the player can do.

So, there are two stages to battle communication: the first is the council of war, before the battle, in which the battle plan is agreed. For the non-player characters to have any significant input into this, we'd need a really good knowledge base of appropriate battle strategies with heuristics for which plan fits which sort of geography and which sort of enemy, but that could be quite fun to develop; but in principle it's sufficient for the player character to be able to say to each of the divisional captains "I want you to do this," and for each captain to say first "yes, I understand" (or "please clarify"), and then "yes, I will do it" (or "yes, I will try").

No battle plan, of course, survives first contact with the enemy. It must be possible to update the plan during the battle, and messengers were used to carry new orders from the commander to subordinates. That, of course, we can also do.

So, ideally (and in describing this I'll try to give 'less than ideal' alternatives where I see them), you can gather your captains to a council of war, either by speaking to them directly or by sending messengers round. At the council of war, non-player-character captains can suggest possible battle plans drawn from a common knowledge base, but can have individual levels of boldness or caution. However, if you've been appointed battle leader, then provided they're individually still loyal to you then they will ultimately agree to what you order.

When battle is joined you can either join in the fighting in the front line in which case your strategic overview is going to be very limited and you'll just have to hope your initial plan was good enough; or else you can sit on a hilltop overlooking the battlefield with your trumpeter and your messengers, and send messages to control the fight, but not actually take part much yourself (unless everything really goes to shit and your position is overrun).

In real world battles orders were often misunderstood; I don't think I should do anything special to model that. But orders (other than trumpet calls) will necessarily take finite time, and if the battlefront is really messed up messengers may fail to get through.
