# Game-engine integration (unfinished)

To build a game using these ideas we need a lot of things that are well understood and already implemented: rendering a world, moving models of characters in a world, and so on. This collection of technologies which allow us to realise an interactive realisation of a world is typically called a game engine.

It's my intention that the bits that I add to the mix should be open source in the hard sense of that phrase, fully free software released under GPL. They cannot therfore be directly linked to a proprietary game engine. 

But the current state of play is that the best and easiest to work with game engines are not open source; and while I could build a demo game using, for example, the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) or [jMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/) the result wouldn't be as compelling and *I believe* the effort would be more considerable than if I use [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), which is my current plan.
