# the-great-game
Prototype code towards the great game I've been writing about for ten years, and know I will never finish

## Awful warning

This doesn't work and isn't ever likely to fully work: it's way too ambitious for any single person to actually build. Feel free to mine it for algorithms and ideas, but don't expect a game you can actually play any time soon.

## There is (masses of) documentation
